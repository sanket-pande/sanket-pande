ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sanket-pande

ðŸ‘€ I have always loved puzzles. When i first wrote my <i>Hello World</i> program on the School computer, I fell in love with computers and problem solving.

I love everything about computers may it be Software, Hardware, Networking, Architecture and of course the Memes.
