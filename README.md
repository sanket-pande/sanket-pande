ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sanket-pande

ðŸ‘€ I've been hooked on puzzles since day one! 

Writing my first `"Hello World"` program on the school computer was like cracking a code. It sparked my love for computers and problem-solving. 

From software to hardware, networking to architecture, and yes, even the memes, I find endless fascination in the world of computers.
